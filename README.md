# Smart-Home-Project

I recently decided to turn my "dumb" home into a smart one. My main goal was to be able to control everything from the Apple Home app. Since everyone in my house has an iPhone, it seemed to be the best option (plus I really like the Home app minimalist UI).
I ran into multiple issue during the process so I decided to create this documentation to remind myself how I got over each issue, as well as help others who might encounter the same issues.

# CHOOSING AN ECOSYSTEM

## Which one did I choose ?

There are 3 main ecosystems when it comes to smart home: Apple's Homekit, Google Home and Amazon's Alexa. They each have their pros and cons, and people with different tastes or means will have different preferences. I chose Apple's solution for many reasons:
  - Everyone in my house has at least an iPhone, we also have MacBooks, iPads and I have an Apple Watch, so we are all comfortable with Apple's ecosystem.
  - I find the Home app minimalist UI very pleasing and easy to use.
  - I am into iOS programming so if I ever start a smart home project, it is likely to be embedded in Apple's ecosystem.
  - We have a Google Nest and most Homekit compatible products also work with Google Home, whereas the opposite isn't necessarily true.
  - I tend to trust Apple over Google or Amazon when it comes to privacy.
