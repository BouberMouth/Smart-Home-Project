# Smart-Home-Project

I recently decided to turn my "dumb" home into a smart one. My main goal was to be able to control everything from the Apple Home app. Since everyone in my house has an iPhone, it seemed to be the best option (plus I really like the Home app minimalist UI).
I ran into multiple issue during the process so I decided to create this documentation to remind myself how I got over each issue, as well as help others who might encounter the same issues.
